# brexerise

This application reminds you to take a break from coding or working at a desk every hour or so and do some exercises and stretching. If you're like me and you do a lot of work at home, you might find it useful.

I wrote this app mainly to learn about Python's asyncio library. It uses the curses library to display text-based UI in the terminal.

Right now this application will probably only work in Mac OSX with Python 3.
